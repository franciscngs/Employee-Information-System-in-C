🗃 Data Format

All records are stored in a file called record.txt with the following format per line:

    EmployeeID|EmployeeName|EmployeeAddress|DeptName|Position|YearHired

Example:

    EMP001|Juan Dela Cruz|123 Buendia St, Manila|IT|Programmer|2010


🧮 Loyalty Award Logic

The function yearsInService() calculates how many years the employee has been with the company by subtracting YearHired from CURRENT_YEAR (defined as 2025 in the code). If the result is 10 or more, the employee qualifies as a Loyalty Awardee.
